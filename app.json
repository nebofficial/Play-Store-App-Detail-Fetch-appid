It will be a very tough war, fortunately you wont't need an internet connection to destroy your enemies, play this offline game anywhere.\n\nTo win this war you will have a large arsenal of weapons and grenades at your disposal: machine guns, assault rifles, shotguns and a wide variety of grenades will be your allies against the enemy.\n\nAnd what about if you need to equip yourself even better? You have to be prepared for battle, that's why you have many gadgets in the store: headbands and masks so that enemies don't recognize you, goggles and telescopic sights to aim from great distances (like a sniper), bulletproof vest that absorb impacts, camouflage paint that makes you invisible in the jungle... and of course a great choice of t-shirts and pants to keep you on trend!\n\nDuring your mission you will not be alone. The armed forces will provide you with different vehicles to help you destroy the enemy once and for all: ride a horse to jump higher and run faster, ride a jet ski to conquer rivers, ride a motorcycle while shooting enemy troops, and best of all, you can put on a metallic flying suit... you will be a metal soldier!\n\nThis game is very easy to play: keep your finger pressed on the screen to move forward, stop pressing to move backwards, swipe to jump and dash, press the grenade button to deliver a devastating blow. How to shoot and kill enemies? Just get near them and the bullets from your gun will visit them.\n\nDo you want to play freely everywhere? Don't worry, Ramboat 2 is the offline runner you are going to enjoy, there is no wifi required, just start and play.\n\nDon't hesitate anymore, lock and load!",
